However, if they cannot afford it, the local government may step in to address the public safety risk. Here’s how it usually works:\n\n1. **Owner Responsibility**: The owner is first notified and given a deadline to address the issue, including demolition if necessary.  \n2. **Government Action**: If the owner cannot or does not act, the local government may arrange for demolition.  \n3. **Cost Recovery**: The government may place a lien (a legal claim) on the property to recover costs. This means the owner must pay the debt when selling or refinancing the property.  \n\n### Options for Owners Who Cannot Afford Demolition:\n- **Financial Assistance**: Some cities or counties offer grants, loans, or payment plans to help cover costs. Check with your local housing or code enforcement office.  \n- **Nonprofit Support**: Local nonprofits may assist with unsafe housing issues.  \n- **Selling the Property**: Selling the property “as-is” may transfer responsibility to the buyer.  \n\n### Next Steps:\n1.
