# AGENTS.md — Repo Guidance for Codex Agents

- Always ensure time logged anywhere is in IST and down to seconds
- If user queries require new libraries that you need to import, do not add fallback to the existence of this library unless explicity specified. User will install it if needed.
- Any point you mention there are serveral tasks to be done, and user requests you to do only one, do that one task only unless explicitly specified otherwise, at the end, ask if other tasks you specified needs to be done. DO NOT DO TASKS THAT ARE NOT ASKED.
- Always update documentation to reflect any significant changes but keep it brief(README, this file).
